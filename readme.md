## MonsoonForRoblox
Monsoon was a Minecraft hacked client previously available on [intent.store](https://intent.store/) and [monsoon.wtf](https://web.archive.org/web/20231211032353/https://monsoon.wtf/) before it was eventually ratted and later discontinued. This time, it’s back on Roblox for Minecraft styled games, made purely for fun. This project is heavily inspired by [VapeV4ForRoblox](https://github.com/7GrandDadPGN/VapeV4ForRoblox/tree/main), and the original discontinued [Monsoon project](https://web.archive.org/web/20231211032353/https://monsoon.wtf/).
